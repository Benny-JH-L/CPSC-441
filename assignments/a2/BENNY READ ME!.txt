For a2 we are ONLY building a proxy server, (idk maybe a client server is needed).

This proxy server will listen to ONLY HTTP requests (to sites), from a web browser (use firefox).

The proxy server will intercept the user's request to the site, and from the proxy server it will 
send the users' request to the site and recieve the data, but in the proxy server it will replace
half of the original images with meme images that is chosen randomly.
